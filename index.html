<h1>My Love,</h1>
<p>In the journey of life, I find myself often the one who ignites the storms. But you—you are the most extraordinary soul I know, the embodiment of everything good I’ve ever done. You are the fruit of every virtuous action I’ve taken, and for that, I am forever grateful.</p>
<p>My heart aches with regret for the moments when my anger has cast a shadow over your light. It is a pain I never wish to inflict again. I long for your forgiveness and a chance to make things right, not just today, but every day.</p>
<p>To me, love isn’t confined to special occasions—it’s in every heartbeat, every glance, every word shared. Valentine’s Day is but a reminder to cherish you, but in my world, every day is an opportunity to celebrate the love we share.</p>
<p>Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. You mean the world to me, now and always.</p>
